/**
 * Manual Test Plan for Backward Navigation State Preservation
 * 
 * This test plan verifies that the enhanced NavigationContext properly preserves
 * filter state, sorting, pagination, and search when navigating between pages.
 */

/**
 * Test Case 1: Filter State Preservation
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to /catalog
 * 2. Apply filters: Make=BMW, Fuel=Petrol, Year=2020-2023
 * 3. Set sorting to "Price: Low to High"
 * 4. Navigate to page 2
 * 5. Add search term "sedan"
 * 6. Click on any car to view details
 * 7. Click "Kthehu te Makinat" to go back
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Should return to catalog page 2
 * - BMW, Petrol, Year 2020-2023 filters should still be applied
 * - Price: Low to High sorting should still be selected
 * - Search term "sedan" should still be in search box
 * - Same filtered results should be displayed
 * - Scroll position should be restored to where user was
 */

/**
 * Test Case 2: Session Storage Persistence
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Follow Test Case 1 steps 1-6
 * 2. Refresh the page (simulating page reload)
 * 3. Click "Kthehu te Makinat" to go back
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Same as Test Case 1 (state persists across reloads)
 */

/**
 * Test Case 3: State Expiration
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Simulate state older than 30 minutes by manually editing sessionStorage
 * 2. Navigate back from car details
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Expired state should be ignored
 * - Should fall back to default state without filters
 */

/**
 * Test Case 4: Backward Compatibility
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to catalog without any special navigation context
 * 2. Apply some filters and navigate to car details
 * 3. Use browser back button instead of "Kthehu te Makinat"
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Should still work, though may not preserve complete state
 * - Should not throw any errors

/**
 * Technical Implementation Verification
 * 
 * Key points to verify in code inspection:
 * 
 * 1. NavigationContext.tsx:
 *    - FilterState interface uses SearchReq types ✓
 *    - setCompletePageState captures filter store state ✓
 *    - restorePageState restores filter store state ✓
 *    - getCurrentFilterState accesses filter store ✓
 * 
 * 2. LazyCarCard.tsx:
 *    - Calls setCompletePageState on navigation ✓ (existing)
 *    - No changes needed due to automatic state capture ✓
 * 
 * 3. CarDetails.tsx:
 *    - Uses navigation context for back button ✓ (existing)
 *    - Triggers restorePageState on catalog return ✓ (existing)
 * 
 * 4. EncarCatalog.tsx:
 *    - Calls restorePageState on mount ✓ (existing)
 *    - Works with filter store for state sync ✓ (via enhanced context)
