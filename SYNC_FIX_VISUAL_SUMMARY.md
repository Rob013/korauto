## Visual Summary: Sync 1% Stuck Issue Fix

### Before Fix:
```
🔄 Syncing... 1,900 / 200,000 cars (1.0%) - Running for 15min
❌ Sync stuck at 1% for extended periods
⏱️  Detection: Only after 10 minutes of inactivity  
🔧 Recovery: Generic 5-second delay for all failures
📊 Progress: Based on incorrect 200,000 total
```

### After Fix:
```
🚨 Stuck sync detected: (low_progress_stagnant)
   - Progress: 1.0% (1,900 / 190,000 cars)  
   - Running for: 15 minutes
   - Stagnant for: 3 minutes
   - Enhanced detection: ACTIVATED

🔄 Enhanced Auto-resume: Attempting PRIORITY resume...
   - Resume delay: 2 seconds (low progress)
   - Target: All 190,000 API cars
   - Status: Enhanced recovery active

✅ Improvements Applied:
   - Faster stuck detection (3 min vs 10 min for low progress)
   - Priority recovery (2s vs 5s for low progress syncs)  
   - Accurate totals (190,000 vs 200,000)
   - Completion validation (warns if < 95%)
```

### Key Behavioral Changes:

1. **Early Detection**: Syncs at 1-5% progress now detected as stuck after 3 minutes of inactivity (vs 10 minutes)

2. **Priority Recovery**: Low progress syncs resume in 2 seconds instead of 5 seconds

3. **Accurate Progress**: 1,900 cars now shows as 1.0% of 190,000 (vs 0.95% of 200,000)

4. **Completion Validation**: Syncs claiming "complete" at 50% now show warnings

5. **Better Logging**: Progress percentage and stuck reason now logged for monitoring

### User Experience Impact:
- Faster resolution of 1% stuck syncs  
- More accurate progress reporting
- Reduced downtime from stuck states
- Better visibility into sync health
- Proactive detection of incomplete syncs
