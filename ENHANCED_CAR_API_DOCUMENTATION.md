# Enhanced Car API and Sold Car Removal Implementation

This document describes the enhanced car API system and improved sold car removal functionality implemented for the KorAuto platform.

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Car API Sync (`enhanced-encar-sync`)

**New Features:**
- **Comprehensive Data Validation**: Cars are validated for required fields and data quality before processing
- **Batch Processing**: Cars are processed in configurable batches (default: 50) for better memory management
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved retry logic with exponential backoff and better error reporting
- **Data Enrichment**: Additional metadata extraction including damage reports, repair costs, and condition mapping
- **Performance Optimization**: Larger page sizes (250 vs 200) and optimized rate limiting

**Validation Rules:**
- Required: car ID, manufacturer name, model name
- Year validation: Must be between 1900 and current year + 2
- Price validation: Must be between 0 and 10,000,000
- Mileage validation: Must be between 0 and 1,000,000 km

**Configuration:**
```javascript
const ENHANCED_CONFIG = {
  RATE_LIMIT_DELAY: 1500,
  MAX_RETRIES: 5,
  PAGE_SIZE: 250,
  BATCH_SIZE: 50,
  VALIDATION_THRESHOLD: 0.95 // 95% of cars must be valid
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Sold Car Removal

**New Functions:**

#### `enhanced_remove_sold_cars(immediate_removal, cleanup_related_data)`
- **Immediate Removal**: Option to remove sold cars immediately (bypass 24-hour delay)
- **Cascading Cleanup**: Automatically clean up user favorites, view history, and queue images for cleanup
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed tracking of cleanup operations

#### `bulk_delete_cars(car_ids, delete_reason)`
- **Bulk Operations**: Delete multiple cars in a single operation
- **Custom Reasons**: Configurable deletion reasons for audit trails
- **Error Handling**: Individual car failures don't stop the entire operation

#### `process_image_cleanup_queue(batch_size)`
- **Asynchronous Image Cleanup**: Process queued image deletions in batches
- **Failure Recovery**: Failed image deletions are marked and can be retried
- **Configurable Batch Size**: Process images in configurable batches

### 3. Enhanced Car Management API (`enhanced-car-management`)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /functions/v1/enhanced-car-management`
- `GET /functions/v1/enhanced-car-management?action=remove_sold_cars&immediate_removal=true`

**Actions:**
- `remove_sold_cars`: Remove sold cars with options
- `bulk_delete_cars`: Delete multiple cars by ID
- `process_image_cleanup`: Process image cleanup queue

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
// Remove sold cars immediately with cleanup
const result = await fetch('/functions/v1/enhanced-car-management', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'remove_sold_cars',
    options: {
      immediate_removal: true,
      cleanup_related_data: true
    }
  })
});

// Bulk delete cars
const result = await fetch('/functions/v1/enhanced-car-management', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'bulk_delete_cars',
    options: {
      car_ids: ['12345', '67890'],
      delete_reason: 'admin_bulk_delete'
    }
  })
});
```

### 4. Enhanced Frontend Hook (`useEnhancedCarManagement`)

**Features:**
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live sync status and car count updates
- **Error Management**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and operation tracking

**Usage:**
```typescript
const {
  triggerEnhancedSync,
  removeSoldCars,
  bulkDeleteCars,
  processImageCleanup,
  syncStatus,
  loading,
  error,
  activeCarsCount,
  totalCarsCount
} = useEnhancedCarManagement();

// Trigger enhanced sync
await triggerEnhancedSync('daily');

// Remove sold cars immediately
await removeSoldCars(true, true);

// Bulk delete cars
await bulkDeleteCars(['1', '2', '3'], 'admin_cleanup');
```

### 5. Admin Management Panel

**Features:**
- **Visual Dashboard**: Real-time stats and operation status
- **Bulk Operations UI**: Easy interface for bulk car deletion
- **Sync Management**: Enhanced sync controls with progress tracking
- **Image Cleanup**: Manual processing of image cleanup queue
- **Operation History**: View results of recent operations

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### New Tables

#### `image_cleanup_queue`
```sql
CREATE TABLE image_cleanup_queue (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  car_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  image_urls JSONB,
  queued_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
);
```

### Enhanced Views

#### Updated `active_cars` View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_cars AS
SELECT * FROM cars 
WHERE 
  -- Enhanced filtering logic
  (
    (is_archived = false OR archived_at IS NULL)
    OR 
    (
      is_archived = true 
      AND archived_at IS NOT NULL 
      AND archived_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
      AND status NOT IN ('immediately_removed_after_sold', 'admin_bulk_delete')
    )
  )
  AND is_active = true
  AND status NOT IN ('removed_after_sold', 'immediately_removed_after_sold', 'admin_bulk_delete');
```

### New Scheduled Jobs

```sql
-- Enhanced daily cleanup
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'enhanced-daily-sold-car-cleanup',
  '0 3 * * *',
  $$ SELECT enhanced_remove_sold_cars(FALSE, TRUE); $$
);

-- Image cleanup processor (every 6 hours)
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'image-cleanup-processor',
  '0 */6 * * *',
  $$ SELECT process_image_cleanup_queue(200); $$
);
```
