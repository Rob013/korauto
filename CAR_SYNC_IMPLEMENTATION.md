# Car Sync Implementation Summary

This document outlines the implementation of the car sync system for KorAuto that meets all the requirements specified.

## Implementation Overview

### 1. ✅ Scripts/sync-cars.ts
Created `scripts/sync-cars.ts` with the following optimized features:
- Uses environment variables from GitHub secrets (SUPABASE_*, API_BASE_URL, API_KEY)
- **OPTIMIZED:** Maximum page size of 1,000 cars per API request (reduced from 100)
- **OPTIMIZED:** Bulk insert batching of 5,000 records for maximum speed
- **OPTIMIZED:** Reduced rate limiting to 1 second between requests
- Implements robust API request handling with retry logic and rate limiting
- Transforms API data to match the database schema
- Uses staging table approach for atomic data updates
- Handles TypeScript strict typing throughout

### 2. ✅ GitHub Workflow
Created `.github/workflows/sync-cars.yml` with:
- Daily schedule at 03:00 Europe/Belgrade (02:00 UTC)
- Manual trigger capability (workflow_dispatch)
- Loads all required GitHub secrets as environment variables:
  - SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID
  - SUPABASE_URL
  - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
  - SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD
  - API_BASE_URL
  - API_KEY
- Verification step to check sync results
- Cleanup on failure to maintain database integrity

### 3. ✅ Database Schema Updates
Updated `db/supabase-init.sql` with:
- Added `cars_staging` table with identical structure to `cars` table
- Added `is_active` field to main `cars` table (defaults to `true`)
- Created indexes for performance on staging table
- Added RLS policies for staging table security

### 4. ✅ RPC Functions
Implemented two critical RPC functions as requested:

#### `bulk_merge_from_staging()`
- Inserts new cars from staging to main table
- Updates existing cars with latest data from staging
- Returns JSON with counts of inserted/updated records
- Atomic operation for data consistency

#### `mark_missing_inactive()`
- Marks cars as `is_active=false` when they disappear from API
- Only affects cars from `external` source API
- Updates status to 'inactive'
- Returns JSON with count of cars marked inactive

### 5. ✅ API Integration
The script properly:
- Reads from the API specified by `API_BASE_URL` + `API_KEY` secrets
- **OPTIMIZED:** Uses maximum page size of 1,000 cars per request to minimize API calls
- **OPTIMIZED:** Implements bulk insert batching of 5,000 records for optimal performance
- Supports pagination for large datasets
- Implements retry logic and optimized rate limiting (1 second between requests)
- Transforms API data to match database schema
- Stores all cars in Supabase via staging table approach

### 6. ✅ Inactive Car Management
The system ensures sold cars are marked `is_active=false` when they disappear from the API:
- Uses staging table to track current active cars from API
- After sync, calls `mark_missing_inactive()` RPC function
- Cars not in staging (i.e., missing from API) are marked inactive
- Only affects external API cars, preserving other data sources

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
SUPABASE_URL=https://your_project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.com/api
API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Sync Process Flow
1. Clear `cars_staging` table
2. **OPTIMIZED:** Fetch cars from external API with 1,000 cars per page (maximum allowed)
3. **OPTIMIZED:** Transform and batch insert cars into `cars_staging` in batches of 5,000
4. Call `bulk_merge_from_staging()` to update main table
5. Call `mark_missing_inactive()` to mark missing cars as inactive
6. Clean up staging table

### Performance Optimizations
- **PAGE_SIZE: 1,000** - Maximum allowed page size to reduce API calls by 10x
- **BATCH_SIZE: 5,000** - Bulk insert batching for optimal database performance
- **RATE_LIMIT_DELAY: 1,000ms** - Optimized rate limiting (reduced from 2 seconds)
- **Batch Processing:** Cars are inserted in optimal chunks to balance memory usage and performance

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with proper logging
- Retry logic for API requests with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting to respect API limits
- Cleanup procedures for failed syncs
- Detailed error reporting in workflow

### Testing
- Added test for script importability and basic functionality
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Database schema validation passes
- Build process works correctly

## Usage

### Manual Execution
```bash
npm run sync-cars
```

### Scheduled Execution
The GitHub workflow runs automatically daily at 03:00 Europe/Belgrade.

### Manual Trigger
The workflow can be manually triggered from the GitHub Actions tab.
